## FINAL NOTES

**The .pro domain is great because:**
✅ Emphasizes "professional" positioning
✅ Shorter than fieldlogpro.com alternatives
✅ Premium feel (.pro = professional)
✅ Available at good price
✅ Memorable and brandable

**Branding tip:**
Always use "FieldLog Pro" (capital F, capital L, capital P) in official contexts.
In casual conversation: "FieldLog" is fine.

**Domain alternatives you also own:**
If you grabbed others (like .io or .com variants), set up redirects:
- getfieldlog.com → fieldlog.pro
- fieldlogpro.io → fieldlog.pro
- usefieldlog.com → fieldlog.pro

This captures typos and alternative searches.

the marketing site at fieldlog.pro.
